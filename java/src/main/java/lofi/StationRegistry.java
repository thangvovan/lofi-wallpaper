     * Holding the stream directly does not work: creating one means resolving and
     * spawning ffmpeg, which is far too slow to do inside a map function, and
     * doing it outside leaves a window where both callers see an empty map and
     * both start a process. Checking "is the existing one alive?" does not close
     * that window either - a stream that has been constructed but not yet started
     * has no process, so it reports not alive and gets replaced. The observable
     * result was two ffmpeg processes for one station.
     *
     * computeIfAbsent runs the creation exactly once per key; everyone else waits
     * on the same future.
